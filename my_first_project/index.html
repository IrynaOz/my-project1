                                    of the species. With a typical head-to-body

                                    Groups of female lions usually hunt

                                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator,

                                    larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72
                                    in). It is a social species, forming groups
                                    called prides. A lion pride consists of a
                                    few adult males, related females and cubs.
                                    Groups of female lions usually hunt
                                    together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
                                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator,
                                    although some lions scavenge when
                                    opportunities occur, and have been known to
                                    hunt humans, although the species typically
                                    does not.

                                    The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the
                                    family Felidae; it is a muscular,
                                    deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head,
                                    a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy
                                    tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
                                    dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent
                                    mane, which is the most recognisable feature
                                    of the species. With a typical head-to-body
                                    length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are
                                    larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72
                                    in). It is a social species, forming groups
                                    called prides. A lion pride consists of a
                                    few adult males, related females and cubs.
